"At last last google home is in India.
Ordered on The Launch Day.
Came along with the Free JioFi.
Proper Packing and Next Day Delivery.
This is a pretty good Virtual Assistant with many useful functions.
I'm still exploring them and will share the useful ones as I come along.
For now I use it,
- As an Alarm
- To set timers
- Adding things to the shopping List ( which in turn will come to the Phone )
- Setting Reminders
- Creating Calendar Events ( Appointments )
- A Dictionary & Encyclop..."
Mind blowing thing. Preordered and got in time. Google mini rocks
"Hey everyone, try the app IFTTT. You will be able to do many things with your Google Home or Echo devices then.
I have both Google Home Mini and Amazon Echo Dot. And as many others have explained, Home Mini beats Echo Dot by leaps and bounds.
Echo Dot's colourful ring is more fun to look at than Home Mini's four white dots. Google should at least make them show colour. And Alexa has cuter voice than Google Assistant. Rest in everything, Home Mini wins.
I love both of them like my two girlf..."

"Amazing assistant by Google ... Have many features like, using Wikipedia by voice command, getting information on any topic, playing any songs as and when u requested, and so many features like quiz on various topics, learning English and traffic at ur home and work location..... And google Still adding many more features in Google Home App..... Works with power bank too...."
Great Product ...Is still not 100% perfect but still is a great buy. + You do get JioFi For free worth Rs. 999. and the speaker quality is also above average. It doesn't always recognize's the lyrics of the song with English (United States) but works perfectly fine with English (India)
"Google home mini is very good device and a smart speaker.
it works trumendouly well in USA , Canada But in India it's kinda disappointing.
Problem arises with its mic itself we can't control home mini when it plays a song command ""hey Google"" it just can't recognise you need to scream louder and It then recognises sometimes not even when i scream . Then i use my home app and change the music but Alexa is far better and has a good mic recognition.
Google home in India lacks lot of featu..."
"This is an awesome device. It has become one of the family member :-), it's very handy if you have small kids at home. This becomes a knowledge device. It can also understand Hindi now, although not very well yet. It does not allow to make calls yet, but going to be possible soon. It can show pictures from google photos."
super fast delivery in 12 hrs
"1. You will get an excellent music player
2. Very fair speaker output immerse sound to fill a room
3. Mic response is very much good and in between playing a music at loud sound you may have to speak louder.
4. You can connect your phone via bluettoth as a bluetooth speaker.
5. Other bluetooth speakers can be paired with G H mini using Google Home app
6. Cute look
7. No batteries , you have to connect power source or may have tonuse powerbank to turn it on."

Every thing is awesome.it works great just can't make calls yet but the update will come to India soon as it has already come to US and UK. It works well Chromecast and don't get mistaken with the small size of the mini. It's loud enough to fill a 300 sq feet room with sound. Got a piece without the connecting Cable but gat it replaced with a new one. No problems till now. To get access to a couple of more useful features set your language settings to English US. Great deal and also got a Jio...
"I got the product for a deal for 3500, it was great. Note that all features are currently not available in india. I saw youtube videos to understand the features, however many of them are not working. I tried updating firmware but no luck, can't update firmware...
Sound quality is good, i use it to play songs from ganna. it can play songs without use of mobile, that's an added advantage.
I have a Google Chromecast which increases the experience.
Waiting for firmware update...."
"Itâ€™s a cute little product. Easy to configure. I already have an Echo at my place so I would be comparing with it. Home has two mics. Echo has six. This was quite apparent within the first few minutes of using the Mini. It missed a lot of my commands. Even when there was little noise around, it took me multiple attempts to get it to respond. Echo is amazing in comparison. Maybe the regular Google Home does it better but from my understanding, both have similar hardware for picking up commands..."
"Honestly, this is just an interactive speaker for now in India. Here's what you can't do - Book cabs, theatres, read from specific newsstand, control your Samsung SmartTV. Point is - Google Home is not India ready. Max to max, IFTTT can be your friend when using this device.
Moreover, there is no return policy from Flipkart, just replacement. I opted for Echo Dot after selling this one on OLX 2 days later."
"It works like a magic, wish it could have had a small better to make it completely portable. But as the name suggests, it's Google HOME, so it stays at home, and powered always. Apart from that there are no complaints what so ever. It's one of the best product, sound quality is amazing for a speaker of such size. Love its built and design and simplicity. Those who knows to use it will enjoy it... Makes u more lazy..."
not much features in India
"this device making my life very easy
you should buy this device
Google home mini is very nice device"
Nice product and nicely integrated to work with surroundings...
